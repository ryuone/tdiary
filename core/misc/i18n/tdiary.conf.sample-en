#-------
# The items which you can't configure with browser
#-------

# The directory where the diary's data are stored.(must)
#   tDiary stores your diary's data in this directory. You usually 
#   assign this item to the directory which can't be accessed through WWW. 
#   This directory's permission is set so that WWW server can 
#   write files in it.
@data_path = '/home/foo/diary'

# The format of the diary(optional)
#   If you change the format of the diary from the default, 
#   you must add some items to your configuration file.
#   In default, tDiary uses the format of tDiary2.
#   What you must configure depends on the format of diary.
#   Please see the document of the program which enable tDiary to 
#   use other format.
#   If "#" of the below two lines are eliminated, tDiary uses the format of tDiary1.
#require 'tdiary/pstoreio'
#@io_class = TDiary::PStoreIO

# Basic mail configuration(optional)
#   @smtp_host and @smtp_port are assigned to the SMTP server name and
#   the port number. If you want tDiary to notify a new comment by mail, 
#   you must configure these variables.
#
#   この2行を訳すと、misc/mail-via-*.rbまで訳さないといけないんですが。 （みずほ）
#   なお、メールの送信手段としては、SMTP以外にも差し替え可能になっていま
#   す。misc/mail-via-*.rbファイルを参照してください。
#
@smtp_host = 'smtp.example.net'
@smtp_port = 25

# Script names for reading or updating your diary(optional)
#   You can set @index and @update to the script filenames for 
#   reading or updating your diary. Normally, these variables have 
#   the default value("./" and "update.rb"). But, if you specify these 
#   variables, you can use tDiary in case when you can't use "DirectoryIndex"
#   or you want to use frame. 
#@index = './'
#@update = 'update.rb'

# Multi-user mode(optional)
#   You use @multi_user when your diary is written by plural persons. 
#   If you set this variable to "true", the multi-user mode is enabled and
#   tDiary change its behavior. In the beginning of the sub-title, writer's name
#   is inserted. The style is like "[user name] sub-title".
#   The editing in multi-uses mode is dangerous. If plural persons
#   write diary at the same time, the diary which is saved precedently 
#   is ignored. You must be careful when you use multi-user mode.
#   The words, "user name", is the name which is used when you login with browser. 
#   Don't forget to add necessary user names to "Require User" of .htaccess.
@multi_user = false

# The receivers to whom tDiary sends e-mail.(optional)
#   You configure @mail_receivers if you use multi-user mode and 
#   plural persons want to receive a comment mail.
#   You don't have to set this item if you use tDiary on one's own.
#   This item is also used if you want to receive a comment mail which
#   is sent to the different address from @author_mail.
@mail_receivers = []

# プラグインの説明は書いていないので、無視します（みずほ）
# プラグインに渡すオプション【オプション】
#   プラグインによっては、tdiary.conf経由でオプションを渡すことで挙動を
#   変更できるものがあります。@optionsはそのオプションを指定する時に使う
#   変数です。指定方法は以下のとおりです。詳しくは各プラグインの説明を参
#   照照して下さい。
#     例: sampleプラグインのhogeオプションを設定
#         @options[sample.hoge] = 'foobar'

#-------
# Items which you can configure with browser
# 
# If necessary, you change these items. 
# Once you do setting with browser, 
# these items' value are not reflected even if you edit "tdiary.conf".  
#-------

# your name and mail address
#   you set @author_name to your name and @author_mail to your mail 
#   address. These values is embeded in the HTML header of your diary.
@author_name = 'Your name'
@author_mail = 'foo@example.net'

# your top page
#   if your website has contents other than diary, you 
#   set @index_page to URL of your website page, for example,
#   the front page of your diary or the top page of your website.
#   This is emebeded in the HTML header and the beginning of 
#   your diary page.
@index_page = 'http://www.example.net/~foo/'

# The title 
#   This is the title of your diary.
#   This must not have the HTML tag.
@html_title = 'hogehoge diary'

# Diary header
#   You sepecify setences which are embeded in the beginning 
#   of your diary. Please change the sentences enclosed by the "HEADER".
#   Because this value is embeded as it is, you can use HTML tag. You 
#   can also use eRuby tag. You feel inconvenient if "%canlendar" and "%navi" 
#   are not in the diary header.
#   
#   <%=calendar%>
#       This is replaced with the calendar. This canlendar has the links to 
#       other monthly page.
#   <%=navi%>
#       This is replaced with the menu through which you can update your diary,
#       do setting and so on.
#
@header = <<HEADER
<%= navi %>
<h1>Foo's diary</h1>
<%=calendar%>

# Diary footer
#   Like the diary header, you can set @footer to sentences which
#   are inserted in the end of your diary page.
#   Please change the sentences enclosed by "FOOTER".

# The format of date
#   You can set @date_format to the format of date. The default value 
#   is "YYYY-MM-DD". You can use all the parameters of Ruby's Time::strftime.
#   The words which are often used are "%Y"(dominical year), "%m"(month),

#   "%a"(abbreviated weekday name) and "%A"(full weekday name).
@date_format = '%Y-%m-%d'

# The anchor of the section and comment
#   You specify words which are used as the section anchor(@section_anchor)
#   and the comment anchor(@comment_anchor).
#   These are enclosed by <a href="...">...</a> in your diary page.
#   If you use span tag whose attribute is sanchor(section anchor) or canchor
#   (comment anchor), the image is shown at the anchor in some themes.

# How many daily diaries "Latest" page has.
#   You decide how many daily diaries are shown in "Latest" page.
#   If the number of the daily diaries doesn't attain the specified number, 
#   diaries in the previous month are also shown.
#
# 最新表示時に最大何日分の日記を表示するかの指定
#   最新日記を表示するページで、最大何日分の日記を出力するかを指定します。

# Theme(theme name or URL of the CSS) 
#   You specify a theme or URL of the CSS. This determines
#   the style of your diary. @theme is set to the default cascading 
#   style sheet. You can change this value and the look of your diary.
#   In the theme directory, there are some themes. If you are interested in  
#   other themes, you try them by changing this value. 
#
#   Of course, you can write your own CSS file. In that case, 
#   you set @theme to "" and @css to the URL of your CSS file.
@theme = 'default'
@css = ''

# Show comments(true or false)
#   You can decide whether today's comments are shown or not. 
#   If you set @show_comment to false, you can hide the comments and
#   readers of your diary can't read them. The diary author can 
#   raed them in the "Update" page if you specify date.
@show_comment = true

# How many comments are shown in "Latest" page and "Daily" page.
#   If today's comments are shown, you sepcify how many comments are
#   shown at most in "Latest" page and "Daily" page.
@comment_limit = 3

# Show today's links(true or false)
#   You can decide whether today's links are shown or not. The link
#   is the URL from which your diary visitor jump to your diary.
#   By this, you can find the page which has the link to your diary.
#   This makes it easy for you to communicate with people through diary.
#   In default, tDiary shows this information to diary readers. If you 
#   don't want diary readers to know it, you set @show_referer to false.
#   Even if this value is set to false, the author can know it in "Update" page 
#   if you specify the date.

# Comment mail configuration
#   If you want to know when your diary has a new comment, 
#   you configure these items. If you set @mail_on_commnet to true, 
#   tDiary send a comment mail to @author_mail according to the below
#   configuration.
# 
#   意味がわかりません。みずほ
#   ツッコミのE-mailフィールドにアドレスが指定されていなかった場合に
#   は、Fromヘッダにも@author_mailが指定されます。
#
#   @mail_header is inserted into the subject of the mail. 
#   You specfiy this variable so that you can easily arrange your comment mail. 
#   The actual subject has the date and comment number. It is like this, 
#   "@mail_header:@date_format-1". If @mail_header includes a word which begins
#   with %, it is regarded as the date format. In other words, ":@date_format" 
#   is not added automatically(comment number is added).

#   訳しましたが、意味がわかりません。(みずほ)
#   ただし、@mail_header中に%に
#   続く英字があった場合、それを日付フォーマット指定を見なします。つまり
#   「:@date_format」の部分は自動的に付加されなくなります(コメント番号は
#   付加されます)。

@mail_on_comment = false

# Time difference adjustment 
#   This item adjusts the date which is automatically inserted into 
#   the page of "update" form. The unit is hour, and you can 
#   use demical number. 
#
#   (誰か書き換えてください) みずほ
#   For example, if you want to handle the time until 2 a.m. as the previous day,
#   you set this to -2. tDiary inserts the date which is older by 2 hours than the actual 
#   time.

# The items to which you can add values with browser
# 
# Though you can set the standard values here, you can't do so
# with browser.

# URLs which are excluded from today's link (Regular Expression)
#   You set a list of URLs which are not recorded as today's link to @no_referer 
#   If all the access are recorded, today's link has some noisy URLs. 
#   Because the purpose of today's link is to find URL which is linked to 
#   your diary, these accesses are annoying; a search engine's access, 
#   an access from your website, and a website fetcher's accesss. 
#   They are excluded if you set their URLs to @no_referer.
#   It is better to add your diary's URL to @no_referer. 
#   The value must be the Array of Ruby and Array's contents are String 
#   of Ruby. Though these Strings are converted to Regular Expression
#   of Ruby when compared, you can't use Regexp of Ruby.

# The rule which convert the specified URL to the word (Regular Expression)
#   @referer_table is configured so that readable URLs are shown in  
#   today's link when you read "daily" page. You add an array of 
#   a URL which will be converted to Regexp and a word which tDiary 
#   replaced the URL with to @referer_table. If a part of URL is 
#   enclosed by parentheses, "\1", "\2", ... in the word are replaced with 
#   the enclosed parts of URL. 
#
#   By the below rule, tDiary replaces URLs from google with "google...".


#   日本語が読めないので、ここは変更します。(みずほ)
#   上の例では、tDiary
#   で運用されている某作者の日記を日付指定、月指定、指定なしのそれぞれの
#   場合について、別々の文字列に置換しています。
